                                    Havelock Island is one of the primary destinations of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is famed for its pristine beauty that goes unmatched when it comes to untouched and unexplored natural beauty and virgin forests of earth. It is a striking contrast of verdant greenery, sandy whiteness and blue vast ocean body. Due to its more than fair share of popularity among tourists and travelers, Havelock has developed luxurious tourist resorts and hotels to pamper the guests living in the lap of intense natural beauty. Havelock is the largest of islands and falls under must-visit destinations. A tour to Andamans would definitely be incomplete without a visit to the Elephant Beach and Radhanagar Beach of Havelock Island. The sublime beauty of the Radhanagar Beach combines with its perfect setting spread against the primitive jungles. The background is filled with a thousand sounds of jungle animals and birds and the secluded beach has “Beware of Crocodiles” marked at places. 
                                    These factors make Radhanagar Beach one of the most coveted destinations of not only Andamans, also of world.

                                    Ross Island caries the rich heritage of the British legacy since the time when India was under the British Rule. It was named after Sir Daniel Ross who was British Marine Surveyor.
                                     As you go through the historical and architectural ruins, you easily get transported to the world of the pre-independence Indian era. Ross Island is definitely a must visit if you are in Andaman and Nicobar islands. The sojourn of the Ross island becomes extremely interesting as you walk through British era Church, Hospital, Bakery, Press, Swimming Pool, Troop Barracks, Ballroom, Chief Commissioner’s House and Government House. Rest in the shade of palm-lined beaches and watch the pipeline of waves crashing on the shores and look around for deer, peacock and ducks all around you. Ross Island is just 2 kilometres from port Blair and can be reached easily by boat in fifteen minutes. It is a point that is covered during your stay in Port Blair.
